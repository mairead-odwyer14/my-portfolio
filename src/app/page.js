        <p className="rounded border-10 border-blue-200 mb-2">I am a third year Integrated Computer Science student at Trinity College Dublin (TCD). 
          I am interested in algorithms and data structures, backend, mathematics and statistics.
          I have worked as a research assistant at TCD's Complex Software Lab and I am currently a demonstrator for a statistics module.
          I have experience in Java, C, R and ARM Assembly.
          Outside of computer science, I enjoy reading, sports and baking delicious treats.

          <h2>Experience</h2>
          <h3>Research Assistant</h3>
          <p>
            I worked as a research assistant in the TCD's Complex Software Lab under Dr Anthony Ventresque.
            My role was to annotate rugby matches using a performance analysis software, Hudl Sportscode.
            The goal of the project was to use the data to determine if the height of tackle in rugby should be lower from the shoulder to the sternum.
            The process was split into two elements, coding and labeling.
            Coding meant that marking down possession, tackles, rucks, passes, kicks and referees' decisions.
            Labeling was for tackles only, where aspects such as type of tackle, head contact for tackle and ball carrier, etc would be marked for each tackle.
            I worked alongside a team of annotators, including a fellow undergrad, a PhD student and two professional rugby players.
            I throughly enjoyed my time as a research assistant. I learned a lot on how these projects are conducted.
            It was great to be able to talk to other memembers of the lab, mainly PhD students and post-doctoral researchers, as I was able to ask for advice and what their experience in computer science was like.
